Overall, the building of this app went smoothly. I started off by going against Matt's advice and just attempted to straight up copy the fruits thing we did in class. Just as Matt predicted, I could not fix all of the errors. After wasting almost an entire day on trying to shift my fruits stuff, I heeded Matt's wise counsel and began to rebuild my app from scratch. I built up the app over the course of about two days by watching the class videos and following along with the class notes. The last two days I spent on minor touch ups to my code and CSS. The main frustrations I had with this project were just silly things like my images not posting properly. Once I got through key hurdles with this project the rest of it went very well. I think this project has increased my confidence about my coding abilities. There were times in unit one where I didn't know if I could get through the homework sometimes. On this project, I knew I could get through it; it's just a matter of typing it all up and then tying up some loose ends. I'm really happy with the theme I chose because I can continue to add on to this project for a long time because there's so many potential things that I can add on to it. I really wanted to link a google maps API to the 'Amazon Distribution' link but wasn't able to cause I ran out of time. I had fun, this project was cool.
